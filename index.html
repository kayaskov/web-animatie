                For the last six years Westinghouse has been preparing the way to a Corporate Design Center. It has the backing of the highest level. The Design Center was the idea of D.C. Burnham, president of Westinghouse. It reports to Marshall Evans, vice president to whom research, engineering, manufacturing and marketing staffs also report. E.W. Seay has been named director of corporate design.
            </p>
            <p>
                Elltiot Noyes is the consultant director of design for Westinghouse. For the past six years he had helped shape the company's design philosophy and has been a moving spirit in establishing the new design center. Paul Rand is graphics consultant. He designed the well-known Westinghouse symbol and guides graphics design in all areas. Charles Eames has produced one film for the company, and hopefully he will do more.

                Westinghouse has been called the most diversified company in the country with over 8,000 different products. We believe a designer can get broader experience, and have the opportunity to do better work, here than in most independent studios.
            </p>
            <p>
                The new design center will have a staff of 30 architects and designers. We already have number of them, but still need: manager, graphic design manager, architecture interior design graphic designers architects en interior designers industrial designers.
